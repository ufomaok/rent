## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze rental prices in Taiwan by looking at historical data of rental prices for properties in Taipei. This project analyzes different X variables (e.g.: house age) against Y variable (rental price). This project consists of univariate analysis and bi-variate analysis to analyze factors that may be associated with rental prices. Using historical data to analyze factors correlating to rental prices can help individuals figure out how prices can vary in the future/how to make well informed decisions about selecting housing/apartment units based on said variable.
