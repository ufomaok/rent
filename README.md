## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze hypothetical rental prices in Taiwan by looking at historical data of rental prices for properties in Taipei. This project analyzes the effects that different X variables (e.g.: house age) have against the Y variable (rental price).

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project. Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

This project consists of univariate analysis and bivariate analysis to analyze factors that may be associated with rental prices. Using sample data to analyze factors correlating to rental prices can help individuals figure out how prices can vary in the future/how to make well informed decisions about selecting housing/apartment units based on said variable. Additional, this project consists of a linear regression model to predict rental prices/see how well model aligns with actual data. One of the challenges/areas of concern arose after reviewing the R2 value (0.5072967410336526), hinting that this model cannot account for 50% of the variation in y, or the rent prices.
